Tell me a story.

MAN: (CHUCKLES)
Which one?

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.560
The story of home.

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.320
Millions of years ago...

7
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.040
a meteorite
made of vibranium...

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.520
the strongest substance
in the universe...

9
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.600
struck the continent
of Africa...

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.680
affecting the plant life
around it.

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.880
And when
the time of man came...

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.880
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.

13
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.160
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.480
until a warrior shaman...

15
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.640
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.840
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...

17
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.280
a plant that granted him

18
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.360
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.

19
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.920
The warrior became king...

20
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.480
and the first Black Panther...

21
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.200
the protector of Wakanda.

22
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.200
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...

23
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.680
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.

24
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.520
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...

25
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.960
more advanced
than any other nation.

26
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.800
But as Wakanda thrived...

27
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.360
the world around it descended
further into chaos.

28
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.760
To keep vibranium safe...

29
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.880
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...

30
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.720
keeping the truth
of their power

31
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.800
from the outside world.

32
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.200
And we still hide,  Baba?

33
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.200
Yes.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.040

KID 5: Hey, yo!

1785
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:30.920
This yours?

1786
02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:36.080
Who...

1787
02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:37.600
Who are you?

1788
02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:44.600
(ALL THE STARS  BY KENDRICK
LAMAR AND SZA PLAYING)

1789
02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:21.520
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

1790
02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:25.760
My name is King T'Challa...

1791
02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:28.040
son of King T'Chaka.

1792
02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:32.520
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.

1793
02:05:32.680 --> 02:05:35.440
And for the first time
in our history...

1794
02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:38.840
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...

1795
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.880
with the outside world.

1796
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:44.400
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.

1797
02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:46.000
We cannot.

1798
02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:48.640
We must not.

1799
02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:51.600
We will work to be an example
of how we...

1800
02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:54.000
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...

1801
02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:56.240
should treat each other.

1802
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:58.240
Now, more than ever...

1803
02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:03.920
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.

1804
02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.280
We all know the truth.

1805
02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:09.840
More connects us
than separates us.

1806
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.680
But in times of crisis...

1807
02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:14.320
the wise build bridges...

1808
02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:17.280
while the foolish
build barriers.

1809
02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:19.480
We must find a way...

1810
02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:22.280
to look after one another...

1811
02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:27.160
as if we were one,
single tribe.

1812
02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:28.800
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...

1813
02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:30.200
what can
a nation of farmers

1814
02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:32.160
have to offer
the rest of the world?

1818
02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.760
Are you playing around
with that man again?

1819
02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:34.840
No.
You're teasing him again.

1820
02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:38.400
Don't wake him. He must rest.
THABO: No, I'm not.

1821
02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:40.720
No, I'm not.

1822
02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:42.880
SHURI: Thabo,
you're doing that.

1823
02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:44.440
KID 2: He's doing it.
He's lying.

1824
02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:46.040
SHURI: No, he's resting.

1825
02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:47.520

1831

How are you feeling?

1832
02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:03.080
Good.

1833
02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:06.800
Thank you.
